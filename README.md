The goal of this project is to create a step_by_step procedure to assess the importance of including local environmental constraints characterization on air quality management, we combined surface meteorological data with air pollution levels from a comprehensive physical and elemental characterization of daily sampling of PM2.5 measured in any study area at local scale.
